# Navira Deployment Fixes Summary

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded File Paths** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** The data loading paths in `navira/data_loader.py` were hardcoded, which works locally but fails in deployment environments.

**Solution:** Updated the data loader to use dynamic paths:
- Uses `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` to get the script directory
- Builds relative paths from the script location
- Added fallback mechanisms for different data directory structures

**Files Modified:**
- `navira/data_loader.py` - Updated path resolution logic
- `lib/national_utils.py` - Added fallback data loading method

### 2. **Authentication Configuration** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** The authentication system needed to be deployment-friendly and support Streamlit secrets.

**Solution:** Enhanced the authentication system to:
- Support Streamlit secrets management
- Maintain backward compatibility with local development
- Use configurable database paths and admin credentials

**Files Modified:**
- `auth.py` - Added secrets support and configuration management

### 3. **Data Loading Robustness** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Data loading could fail if column names didn't match expectations.

**Solution:** Made data loading more robust:
- Added fallback data loading methods
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Made column renaming conditional on column existence

## 🛠️ New Files Created

### 1. **Test Suite** (`test_deployment.py`)
- Comprehensive testing of all deployment components
- Validates data loading, authentication, imports, and file structure
- Provides clear feedback on what needs to be fixed

### 2. **Deployment Guide** (`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Configuration options for different deployment scenarios
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues

### 3. **Deployment Script** (`deploy.sh`)
- Automated deployment preparation
- Runs tests and validates setup
- Guides through the deployment process

### 4. **Streamlit Configuration** (`.streamlit/config.toml`)
- Optimized settings for production deployment
- Security and performance configurations

## 🔧 Key Improvements

### Data Loading
```python
# Before: Hardcoded paths
DATA_DIR_DEFAULT = "data/processed"

# After: Dynamic paths
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
data_dir = os.path.join(script_dir, '..', 'data')
```

### Authentication
```python
# Before: Fixed configuration
DB_PATH = "users.db"

# After: Configurable with secrets support
def get_config():
    if hasattr(st, 'secrets') and st.secrets:
        return st.secrets.get("database", {}).get("path", "users.db")
    return "users.db"
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Before: Simple error
except Exception:
    st.error("Parquet data not found. Please run: make parquet")
    st.stop()

# After: Robust fallback
except Exception as e:
    st.warning(f"Primary data loading method failed: {e}")
    try:
        # Fallback method
        establishments, annual = load_data()
    except Exception as e2:
        st.error(f"Both methods failed. Please check data files.")
```
